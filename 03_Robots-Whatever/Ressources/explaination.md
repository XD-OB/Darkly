# 03 - Robots Whatever

## Reproduce

To search for the directories and files we used `dirsearch` an advanced command-line tool designed to brute force directories and files in webservers (web path scanner)
`https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch`

We used the command:

`python3 dirsearch.py -u {IP}`

==> We found these paths:

- `http://{IP}/robots.txt`
- `http://{IP}/admin`

Inside `robots.txt` we found some rules that forbide the robots from indexing or visiting the following routes:

- `/whatever`
- `/.hidden`

Inside `whatever` we found a file: `htpasswd` that contain this line

`root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3`

Its seem that is the password hashed for the root user.

After decrypting the password with the MD5 hash we got: `dragon`

We used this credentials in the `http://{IP}/admin` section, and tadaaa we got the flag

## Infos

robots.txt, it is a convention which allows to tell bots and crawlers which do page indexing: 'not to "index" certain routes' that we prefer not to see to be displayed on the site

## Explaination of the vulnerability

The `htpasswd` that contain a very sensitive data (root password) can be viewed publicly

## Fix

- Use `htaccess` to protect the folder
- Avoid to store passwords like that
